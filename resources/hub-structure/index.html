<h2 id="actions-team">Actions team</h2>
<p>The actions team devises strategy and tactics to support the overall objectives of the hub. We are in the process of determining new, longer- and shorter-term goals, for which we would love to have your unique creative input!</p>
<h2 id="artsmediacomms">Arts/Media/Comms</h2>
<p>Media gets the word out there to anyone looking for our hub on the internet or via the press and updates the public on what we are doing (preferably in an engaging way!)</p>
<h2 id="community-and-leadership">Community and leadership</h2>
<p>The Community &amp; Leadership Team helps our hub be an inclusive, welcoming environment for all, ensure that we&rsquo;re embodying a just organizing approach that prioritizes anti-oppression &amp; anti-racism, and develops the organizing and leadership skills of our members by providing trainings.</p>
<h2 id="financefundraising">Finance/fundraising</h2>
<p>Our hub is fundraising to host trainings, grow our Equity Fund, purchase supplies for Art Builds, pay for our meeting space, and more. If you have ideas for fundraising (or creative ideas for spending the funds!), join our team! No need to have any background knowledge about finance or fundraising, we&rsquo;re all learning as we go, and training is available.</p>
<h2 id="mutual-aid">Mutual aid</h2>
<h2 id="partnerships">Partnerships</h2>
<h2 id="political-team">Political team</h2>
<p>The political team coordinates Sunrise New Haven’s political actions, builds and maintains relationships with political figures who are GND champions, and helps educate the hub on the political background and current political landscape of New Haven and Connecticut in partnership with other hub teams. We are currently focused on developing an endorsement process and determining how we can show up for GND candidates during the upcoming elections and would love input from everyone no matter your experience or background!</p>
<h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>
<p>Our team focuses on bringing in and welcoming new members, creating fun events for hub members to attend so they can make connections outside the work we do at sunrise, and carrying out 1-1s for any new or current members! We welcome anyone no matter their background experience &lt;3</p>
<h2 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h2>
<p>Our team is learning the practice of storytelling together! Stories help us to connect people to our movement in ways that specifically matter to us and to our community. No experience is required, just an interest in hearing our hub members’ stories and thinking about your own!</p>
